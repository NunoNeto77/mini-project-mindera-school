# mini-project-mindera-school

Hello World! My name is Nuno Neto.

This is a mini project that I did when I was at Mindera School.

This is a project that you can do 3 things: 

1- play an adventure game;
2- buy something in a vending machine;
3- listen to music (only one song I chose).
-------------------------------------------------------

To work with this project:

first, you need to run the main method from mainPackage;
after that, you can choose what you want to do.
